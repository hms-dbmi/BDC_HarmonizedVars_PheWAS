It is corresponding to Cycle 7 clinic examination for Offspring and Cycle 1 for Gen 3.\Volume of the lungs in ml (second scan)\

This ancillary study is a cross sectional evaluation of lumbar spinal degeneration using MDCT scans already collected for the Offspring and Generation 3 cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study. We will use this existing data to examine the prevalence of lumbar spinal degenerative features, and associations with pain and functional limitations, in a sample of individuals who underwent MDCT scans.

Brain MRI was performed between 6/2009 to 12/2013 to establish baseline measures of brain morphology and cognitive function. Two methods have been used to read brain MRIs at Framingham to date. Method 1 is an older method and is no longer being used. Method 2 is a new method. Method 2 did not start until 2009. There are some MRI scans that have been read using both methods.

The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) is a prospective cohort study of sleep disordered breathing and risk of cardiovascular diseases. The SHHS cohort was enrolled in the mid-1990&#39;s from existing epidemiological studies. Detailed questionnaire, body habitus, blood pressure and overnight polysomnographic data were collected from 6441 participants at 6 different investigative sites across the country, including 699 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring. A description of the SHHS procedures and data collection instruments is available on the SHHS website (http://www.jhucct.com/shhs/). The SHHS polysomnography data include 2 central EEG leads. Power spectral analysis of the EEG data was performed to generate the data included in this dataset.\Mean absolute delta power during the first third of sleep epochs\

The non-hip fracture ascertainment procedures were based on the hip fracture procedures. Fracture information was queried at Exam 2 through Exam 8. Attempts were made to verify all hip fractures and recent non-hip fractures (those occurring after 2001) by medical record review. Sources included: x-ray or MRI report, orthopedic, consulting physician or nursing home notes, operation room (OR) or emergency room (ER) reports, discharge summaries. Otherwise, fractures were classified as self-reported without medical record confirmation. Most self-reported non-hip fractures prior to 2002, were not confirmed by medical records. Fractures were initially categorized into 60 detailed skeletal sites and were further collapsed into 21 consolidated categories.\Fracture side\

The goal of this dataset is to 1) identify, confirm and code all malignancies appearing among participants of every generation of the Framingham Heart Study, 2) describe relationships between already identified FHS risk factors and the development of malignancies among participants, and 3) describe interactions among risk factors, CVD, and cancer in the FHS population(s). Included are the codes for all FHS reviewed cases of primary cancers (malignant or in-situ), that have been verified by pathology reports, or occasionally by other clinical records, for all Framingham Heart Study participants in all cohorts who reported a tumor or cancer at an examination or on a health history survey. Excluded are cases described in pathology reports as benign tumors or tumors of borderline malignancy, or cases described as metastases from other primary cancers. Also excluded are recurrences of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers; the first occurrence of each of these series is the only one included for any individual person.\Type of Date - diagnosis date qualifier - indicates the quality of D_DATE\

Hallux valgus was measured as part of the Foot Assessment Clinical Tool, which is a validated foot exam with specific criteria to assess foot pain, foot symptoms and presence of foot disorders. Trained clinical examiners performed all foot exams. Hallux valgus was considered to be present if the angle of the hallux towards the lesser toes was observed to be greater than 15 degrees. Pes cavus was defined using a weight-bearing ratio of arch width to rear-foot width from a bipedal stance on a computerized pressure mat.

The Framingham Foot Study, an ancillary study of the FHS, is an observational cohort study of adults to examine the role of foot disorders upon functional limitations and disability. Foot disorders were assessed using a validated Foot Assessment Clinical Tool that captures the main features of common foot disorders. Reliability of this instrument has been shown to be excellent [Hannan et al., 2001; Hannan et al., 2003]. Briefly, trained clinical examiners conducted a physical examination of a participant's feet, collected data on medical history, plantar pressures using a computerized mat, and administered risk assessment questionnaires. Specific disorders of interest included hallux valgus, toe deformities other than hallux (lesser toe deformities of hammer toes, claw toes and overlapping toes), heel fat-pad atrophy, fore fat-pad atrophy, pes cavus, and pes planus. Information relevant to foot pain was also collected in the questionnaire. The structural foot disorders were indicated as present or absent based on an atlas of pictorial depictions of each foot disorder. For example, heel fat-pad atrophy, this condition was indicated as present or absent based on palpitation of the plantar heel of each foot. If bony prominences were noted at this area with minimal pressure then atrophy was considered present (to indicate decreased fat/muscle mass on the bottom of the heel).\Exam number\
