Soluble ST2 is a peptide with a structural sequence that identifies it as an interleukin-receptor family member. ST2 exists both in membrane-bound form (ST2 ligand, or ST2L) as well as in a shed, truncated soluble form (soluble ST2, or sST2). Although described to play a role in inflammation and tolerance (mediating function of T-helper cells), ST2 clearly has a cardiovascular role, which may be more important than its function in the inflammatory system. Lee and colleagues demonstrated that ST2 gene transcripts were dramatically upregulated in a model of myocyte stretch in a manner reminiscent of BNP. Furthermore, in the context of left ventricular pressure and volume overload, interruption of the ST2 gene leads to a deleterious phenotype marked by unchecked myocardial hypertrophy, dilatation of ventricular chambers, and reduction in ejection fraction. The functional ligand for ST2L and sST2 is interleukin-33, a cardiac fibroblast protein also produced in response to stretch. Interleukin-33 is known to mediate the negative effects of pressure and volume overload on ventricular myocytes; for instance, infusion of this hormone prevents remodeling when the heart is acutely exposed to pressure overload. Collectively, these experimental data suggest that the ST2/IL-33 system plays a key role in the cardiovascular response to pressure and volume overload. Multiple studies have now shown that, in patients with HF or myocardial infarction, elevated sST2 concentrations predict an increased prevalence of cardiac structural abnormalities, elevated filling pressures, recurrent HF events, and death. The prognostic value of sST2 is additive to conventional troponins and BNP/NT-proBNP.

Participants are limited to those who attended Original Cohort Exams 27-28 and Offspring Exam 8. The Framingham Foot Study, an ancillary study of the FHS, is an observational cohort study of adults to examine the role of foot disorders upon functional limitations and disability. Foot disorders were assessed using a validated Foot Assessment Clinical Tool that captures the main features of common foot disorders. Reliability of this instrument has been shown to be excellent [Hannan et al., 2001; Hannan et al., 2003]. Briefly, trained clinical examiners conducted a physical examination of a participant's feet, collected data on medical history, plantar pressures using a computerized mat, and administered risk assessment questionnaires. Specific disorders of interest included hallux valgus, toe deformities other than hallux (lesser toe deformities of hammer toes, claw toes and overlapping toes), heel fat-pad atrophy, fore fat-pad atrophy, pes cavus, and pes planus. Information relevant to foot pain was also collected in the questionnaire. The structural foot disorders were indicated as present or absent based on an atlas of pictorial depictions of each foot disorder. For example, heel fat-pad atrophy, this condition was indicated as present or absent based on palpitation of the plantar heel of each foot. If bony prominences were noted at this area with minimal pressure then atrophy was considered present (to indicate decreased fat/muscle mass on the bottom of the heel).\\Framingham Heart Study participant SHARe ID number\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\Free T4, TSH, Prolactin, Generation 3 Exam 1, New Offspring Spouse Exam 1, Omni 2 Exam 1\\Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Tests\\Hearing\\Hearing Test, Original Cohort Exam 22\\OTOSCOPIC CHECK DONE\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Tests\\CT\\Aortic Valve/Mitral Valve Calcium Score Data, Offspring Cohort Exam 7.

This assay was performed on Generation 3 Exam 1 study participants who had a bone mineral density measured by CT and available plasma samples at Exam 1. This dataset is part of the ancillary study Framingham Osteoporosis Study (FOS). Individuals with homocystinuria, a biochemical abnormality causing elevated plasma Hcy concentrations, have an increased prevalence of osteoporosis. This observation suggested that milder elevations of Hcy may have adverse effects on bone. A recent study by our group found that elevated plasma Hcy concentration was associated with a two to four-fold increased risk of hip fracture in community-dwelling elders. These results were confirmed in the Rotterdam Study for all fractures. None of these studies, however, were able to establish a causal mechanism for the effect of Hcy on fracture. Thus, it is still unclear whether or not Hey directly affects bone strength or is an innocent bystander. Potential candidates for the true causative factor may lie along the pathway of Hcy metabolism. Hcy is metabolized through two metabolic pathways: remethylation and transsulfuration. In remethylation, Hcy is converted to methionine by the donation of a methyl group from 5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate, the main circulating form of folate. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is synthesized from 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate by the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The remethylation of Hey to methionine is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase (MTR). which is activated by the vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthase reductase (MTRR). Through the trans-sulfuration pathway, Hey is converted to cystathionine in a reaction catalyzed by the vitamin B6-containing enzyme cystathionine (3-synthase (CBS). Thus the aim of this study is to test the association between common variants in the above four genes and volumetric BMD of the spine and to test for an interaction between common variants in these four genes and levels of B12, MMA, folate and B6 on volumetric BMD of the spine.\\Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\Fasting Plasma Insulin and Proinsulin, Offspring Cohort Exam 7\\UNIQUE PARTICIPANT ID\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\Creatinine and Cystatin C, Offspring Cohort Exam 7\\UNIQUE PARTICIPANT ID\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Tests\\CT\\CT Coronary Artery and Aorta Calcium Scores, Offspring Cohort Exams 6, 7\\UNIQUE PARTICIPANT ID\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Hematologic\\Hemostatic Factors, Offspring Cohort Exam 5\\UNIQUE PARTICIPANT ID\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Inflammatory Markers\\C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Offspring Exam 8 and Omni 1 Exam 3\\Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Tests\\Vascular: Brachial, Tonometry, PAT\\Vascular Tonometry, Original Cohort Exam 26\\AUTO BLOOD PRESSURE AND PULSE: PULSE (FIRST IF EVEN ID#) (MMHG)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\Insulin - Lab Assay (EDTA plasma), Offspring Exam 9 and Omni 1 Exam 4\\Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Tests\\Bone Study\\Vertebral Fractures Semi-Quantitative Data, Original Cohort Exams 10, 14, and 22.

Participants are limited to those who attended Original Cohort Exams 27-28 and Offspring Exam 8. The Framingham Foot Study, an ancillary study of the FHS, is an observational cohort study of adults to examine the role of foot disorders upon functional limitations and disability. Foot disorders were assessed using a validated Foot Assessment Clinical Tool that captures the main features of common foot disorders. Reliability of this instrument has been shown to be excellent [Hannan et al., 2001; Hannan et al., 2003]. Briefly, trained clinical examiners conducted a physical examination of a participant's feet, collected data on medical history, plantar pressures using a computerized mat, and administered risk assessment questionnaires. Specific disorders of interest included hallux valgus, toe deformities other than hallux (lesser toe deformities of hammer toes, claw toes and overlapping toes), heel fat-pad atrophy, fore fat-pad atrophy, pes cavus, and pes planus. Information relevant to foot pain was also collected in the questionnaire. The structural foot disorders were indicated as present or absent based on an atlas of pictorial depictions of each foot disorder. For example, heel fat-pad atrophy, this condition was indicated as present or absent based on palpitation of the plantar heel of each foot. If bony prominences were noted at this area with minimal pressure then atrophy was considered present (to indicate decreased fat/muscle mass on the bottom of the heel).\\Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Urine Chemistries\\24 Hour Urine Collection, Offspring Exam 9 and Omni 1 Exam 4\\Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Targeted and Untargeted Metabolomics - HILIC - Installment 1, Generation 3 Exam 1.

Soluble ST2 is a peptide with a structural sequence that identifies it as an interleukin-receptor family member. ST2 exists both in membrane-bound form (ST2 ligand, or ST2L) as well as in a shed, truncated soluble form (soluble ST2, or sST2). Although described to play a role in inflammation and tolerance (mediating function of T-helper cells), ST2 clearly has a cardiovascular role, which may be more important than its function in the inflammatory system. Lee and colleagues demonstrated that ST2 gene transcripts were dramatically upregulated in a model of myocyte stretch in a manner reminiscent of BNP. Furthermore, in the context of left ventricular pressure and volume overload, interruption of the ST2 gene leads to a deleterious phenotype marked by unchecked myocardial hypertrophy, dilatation of ventricular chambers, and reduction in ejection fraction. The functional ligand for ST2L and sST2 is interleukin-33, a cardiac fibroblast protein also produced in response to stretch. Interleukin-33 is known to mediate the negative effects of pressure and volume overload on ventricular myocytes; for instance, infusion of this hormone prevents remodeling when the heart is acutely exposed to pressure overload. Collectively, these experimental data suggest that the ST2/IL-33 system plays a key role in the cardiovascular response to pressure and volume overload. Multiple studies have now shown that, in patients with HF or myocardial infarction, elevated sST2 concentrations predict an increased prevalence of cardiac structural abnormalities, elevated filling pressures, recurrent HF events, and death. The prognostic value of sST2 is additive to conventional troponins and BNP/NT-proBNP.

All FHS subjects with nocturnal polysomnography data including EEG polysomnogram were included. For subjects with multiple polysomnograms, only the first polysomnogram was used.\\Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Beta Amyloid, Generation 3 Exam 2 and Omni 2 Exam 2. One of the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the presence of amyloid-containing senile plaques; a key component of these plaques is insoluble forms of the beta-amyloid (AB) protein, specifically AB1-42 and AB1-40. Plasma concentrations of AB1-42 and AB1-40 levels were measured using a fluorimetric immunoassay, to evaluate the clinical correlates, and to assess the prognostic significance in AD and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The limit of detection for this assay is 12pg/ml for AB1-40 and 5pg/ml for AB1-42. All assays were run on a single lot.\\Framingham Heart Study cohort identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\Inflammatory Marker: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Generation 3 and Omni 2, Exam 1.

This study includes immunoassay-generated data for plasma stromal cell derived factor-1a (SDF-1) from Exam 6 of Offspring cohort participants. Characterizing robust biomarkers associated with CVD is necessary for the discovery of disease mechanisms and development of diagnostics. Previous studies suggest that SDF-1 is a highly promising biomarker of CVD. SDF-1 is a CXC chemokine that mediates the immune response by regulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and B-cell proliferation. Variants in the SDF-1 gene CXCL12 are associated with plasma SDF-1 levels. We hypothesize that circulating SDF-1 levels are associated with atherosclerotic CVD. For these reasons, we measured plasma SDF-1 levels using an ELISA-based assay from R and D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, Part #DSA00, http://www.rndsystems.com/pdf/dsa00.pdf. The assay is a 4.5 hour solid-phase ELISA, which measures human SDF-1alpha in platelet-poor plasma.

Characterizing robust biomarkers associated with CVD is necessary for the discovery of disease mechanisms and development of diagnostics. Previous studies suggest that SDF-1 is a highly promising biomarker of CVD. SDF-1 is a CXC chemokine that mediates the immune response by regulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and B-cell proliferation. Variants in the SDF-1 gene CXCL12 are associated with plasma SDF-1 levels. We hypothesize that circulating SDF-1 levels are associated with atherosclerotic CVD. For these reasons, we measured plasma SDF-1 levels using an ELISA-based assay from R and D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, Part #DSA00, http://www.rndsystems.com/pdf/dsa00.pdf. The assay is a 4.5 hour solid-phase ELISA, which measures human SDF-1alpha in platelet-poor plasma. EDTA plasma samples from Exam 6 of Offspring cohort participants were stored at -80C and used immediately after thawing. 3532 Offspring participants completed Exam 6. After exclusion criteria were applied, 3336 measurements qualified for data analysis. These measurements are included in this dataset.\\Framingham Heart Study participant SHARe ID number\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\Inflammatory Marker: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Generation 3 and Omni 2, Exam 1.

This study includes immunoassay-generated data for plasma stromal cell derived factor-1a (SDF-1) from Exam 6 of Offspring cohort participants. Characterizing robust biomarkers associated with CVD is necessary for the discovery of disease mechanisms and development of diagnostics. Previous studies suggest that SDF-1 is a highly promising biomarker of CVD. SDF-1 is a CXC chemokine that mediates the immune response by regulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and B-cell proliferation. Variants in the SDF-1 gene CXCL12 are associated with plasma SDF-1 levels. We hypothesize that circulating SDF-1 levels are associated with atherosclerotic CVD. For these reasons, we measured plasma SDF-1 levels using an ELISA-based assay from R and D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, Part #DSA00, http://www.rndsystems.com/pdf/dsa00.pdf. The assay is a 4.5 hour solid-phase ELISA, which measures human SDF-1alpha in platelet-poor plasma. EDTA plasma samples from Exam 6 of Offspring cohort participants were stored at -80C and used immediately after thawing. 3532 Offspring participants completed Exam 6. After exclusion criteria were applied, 3336 measurements qualified for data analysis.

These data were also used to examine cross sectional relations with brain volume and cognitive function (Tan et al., 2012).\\RBC trans palmitoleic acid (C16:1t) proportion\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\2 Hour Insulin, Offspring Cohort Exam 7\\2 HOUR INSULIN, EXAM 7 (&#956;U/ML)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\2-Hour Post-Oral Glucose Challenge, Offspring Cohort Exam 7\\2-HOUR POST-ORAL GLUCOSE CHALLENGE TEST, EXAM 7 MEASURED IN MG/DL (NOTE: ALL SUBJECTS WITH IGT AND A SUBSET OF SUBJECTS WITH NGT AT EXAM 5 [BLOCK-RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM 5 QUINTILE STRATA OF FBS] WERE OFFERED A MORNING EXAM AT CYCLE 7 INCLUDING AN ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST.)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\2-Hour Post-Oral Glucose Challenge, Offspring Cohort Exam 7\\7 LEVEL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE STATUS AT EXAM 5 USED AS SAMPLING FRAME FOR EXAM 7 OGTT (NOTE: ALL SUBJECTS WITH IGT AND A SUBSET OF SUBJECTS WITH NGT AT EXAM 5 [BLOCK-RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM 5 QUINTILE STRATA OF FBS] WERE OFFERED A MORNING EXAM AT CYCLE 7 INCLUDING AN ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST.)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\2-Hour Post-Oral Glucose Challenge, Offspring Cohort Exam 7\\TESTED FOR 2 HOUR POST-ORAL GLUCOSE CHALLENGE TEST AT EXAM 7 (NOTE: ALL SUBJECTS WITH IGT AND A SUBSET OF SUBJECTS WITH NGT AT EXAM 5 [BLOCK-RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM 5 QUINTILE STRATA OF FBS] WERE OFFERED A MORNING EXAM AT CYCLE 7 INCLUDING AN ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST.)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\Adiponectin, Generation 3, New Offspring Spouse, and Omni 2 Exam 1.

This assay was performed on Generation 3 Exam 1 study participants who had a bone mineral density measured by CT and available plasma samples at Exam 1. This dataset is part of the ancillary study Framingham Osteoporosis Study (FOS). Individuals with homocystinuria, a biochemical abnormality causing elevated plasma Hcy concentrations, have an increased prevalence of osteoporosis. This observation suggested that milder elevations of Hcy may have adverse effects on bone. A recent study by our group found that elevated plasma Hcy concentration was associated with a two to four-fold increased risk of hip fracture in community-dwelling elders. These results were confirmed in the Rotterdam Study for all fractures. None of these studies, however, were able to establish a causal mechanism for the effect of Hcy on fracture. Thus, it is still unclear whether or not Hey directly affects bone strength or is an innocent bystander. Potential candidates for the true causative factor may lie along the pathway of Hcy metabolism. Hcy is metabolized through two metabolic pathways: remethylation and transsulfuration. In remethylation, Hcy is converted to methionine by the donation of a methyl group from 5-mehtyltetrahydrofolate, the main circulating form of folate. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is synthesized from 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate by the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The remethylation of Hey to methionine is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase (MTR). which is activated by the vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthase reductase (MTRR). Through the trans-sulfuration pathway, Hey is converted to cystathionine in a reaction catalyzed by the vitamin B6-containing enzyme cystathionine (3-synthase (CBS). Thus the aim of this study is to test the association between common variants in the above four genes and volumetric BMD of the spine and to test for an interaction between common variants in these four genes and levels of B12, MMA, folate and B6 on volumetric BMD of the spine.\\Methylmalonic acid (sample: EDTA plasma)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Metabolic Hormonal\\Methylmalonic Acid (MMA), Generation 3 Exam 1.

The Framingham Osteoporosis Study, an ancillary study of the Framingham Heart Study, has contributed substantially to the understanding of risk factors for age-related bone loss and fractures in men and women. One of the study aims is to investigate the relationship between vitamin B12, B6, and folate status and volumetric trabecular bone mineral density measured on CT scans from participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Third Generation Multidetector CT Study, (Framingham CT Study) and their interactions with candidate genes in common methylation pathways. Plasma EDT samples collected at Cycle 1 for the 3rd Generation participants. Vitamin B12/Folate were measured from October 2009 through May 2010.

GDF-15 has anti-hypertrophic, anti-apoptic, and anti-remodeling properties, and thus appears to play a protective role in vivo. In animal models, genetic suppression of GDF-15 leads to excessive cardiac hypertrophy. Conversely, stimulation of GDF-15 attenuates cardiac hypertrophy. Samples were collected from citrated plasma.\\Growth differentiation factor-15 (sample: citrated plasma)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Immunoglobulin E (EDTA plasma), Original Exam 24, Offspring Exam 7, Generation 3 Exam 1\\Framingham Cohort Identifier\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Immunoglobulin E (EDTA plasma), Original Exam 24, Offspring Exam 7, Generation 3 Exam 1\\Immunoglobulin E (EDTA plasma)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Lab Assay: Vitamin D and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Offspring Exam 9 and Omni 1 Exam 4\\Framingham Heart Study cohort exam number\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Lab Assay: Vitamin D and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Offspring Exam 9 and Omni 1 Exam 4\\Parathyroid hormone (sample type: EDTA plasma)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Lab Assay: Vitamin D and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Offspring Exam 9 and Omni 1 Exam 4\\Unique study participant identification number\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Lab Assay: Vitamin D and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Offspring Exam 9 and Omni 1 Exam 4\\Vitamin D (sample type: EDTA plasma)\\", "\\Framingham Cohort\\Lab Work\\Blood\\Other or Combination\\Lab Assays Processed at Framingham Heart Study Laboratory - Clinic Exam, Omni 1 Exam 2.

Soluble ST2 is a peptide with a structural sequence that identifies it as an interleukin-receptor family member. ST2 exists both in membrane-bound form (ST2 ligand, or ST2L) as well as in a shed, truncated soluble form (soluble ST2, or sST2). Although described to play a role in inflammation and tolerance (mediating function of T-helper cells), ST2 clearly has a cardiovascular role, which may be more important than its function in the inflammatory system. Lee and colleagues demonstrated that ST2 gene transcripts were dramatically upregulated in a model of myocyte stretch in a manner reminiscent of BNP. Furthermore, in the context of left ventricular pressure and volume overload, interruption of the ST2 gene leads to a deleterious phenotype marked by unchecked myocardial hypertrophy, dilatation of ventricular chambers, and reduction in ejection fraction. The functional ligand for ST2L and sST2 is interleukin-33, a cardiac fibroblast protein also produced in response to stretch. Interleukin-33 is known to mediate the negative effects of pressure and volume overload on ventricular myocytes; for instance, infusion of this hormone prevents remodeling when the heart is acutely exposed to pressure overload. Collectively, these experimental data suggest that the ST2/IL-33 system plays a key role in the cardiovascular response to pressure and volume overload. Multiple studies have now shown that, in patients with HF or myocardial infarction, elevated sST2 concentrations predict an increased prevalence of cardiac structural abnormalities, elevated filling pressures, recurrent HF events, and death. The prognostic value of sST2 is additive to conventional troponins and BNP/NT-proBNP.

Participants are limited to those who attended Original Cohort Exams 27-28 and Offspring Exam 8. The Framingham Foot Study, an ancillary study of the FHS, is an observational cohort study of adults to examine the role of foot disorders upon functional limitations and disability. Foot disorders were assessed using a validated Foot Assessment Clinical Tool that captures the main features of common foot disorders. Reliability of this instrument has been shown to be excellent [Hannan et al., 2001; Hannan et al., 2003]. Briefly, trained clinical examiners conducted a physical examination of a participant's feet, collected data on medical history, plantar pressures using a computerized mat, and administered risk assessment questionnaires. Specific disorders of interest included hallux valgus, toe deformities other than hallux (lesser toe deformities of hammer toes, claw toes and overlapping toes), heel fat-pad atrophy, fore fat-pad atrophy, pes cavus, and pes planus. Information relevant to foot pain was also collected in the questionnaire.

Participants are limited to those who attended Original Cohort Exams 27-28 and Offspring Exam 8. The Framingham Foot Study, an ancillary study of the FHS, is an observational cohort study of adults to examine the role of foot disorders upon functional limitations and disability. Foot disorders were assessed using a validated Foot Assessment Clinical Tool that captures the main features of common foot disorders. Reliability of this instrument has been shown to be excellent [Hannan et al., 2001; Hannan et al., 2003]. Briefly, trained clinical examiners conducted a physical examination of a participant's feet, collected data on medical history, plantar pressures using a computerized mat, and administered risk assessment questionnaires. Specific disorders of interest included hallux valgus, toe deformities other than hallux (lesser toe deformities of hammer toes, claw toes and overlapping toes), heel fat-pad atrophy, fore fat-pad atrophy, pes cavus, and pes planus.
